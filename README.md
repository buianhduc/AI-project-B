# COMP30024 Artificial Intelligence - Assignment 2

# Project structure:
- Our different implementations agents will be in the agent folder. However, our main agent will be in <code>agent/alphaBetaAgentWithCacheV2.py</code> source code file.
- In our init file, we have assign the alias for our Alpha Beta Agent with Cache as the <code>Agent</code>, therefore there's no need to reimport
- Feel free to see other implementations that we did in our project :)
